## Macroeconomic Indicators

Let's now apply the `l1rotation` package to a large panel of US macroeconomic indicators. The below dataset is the FRED_QD data collected and maintained by Michael W. McCracken available [here](https://www.stlouisfed.org/research/economists/mccracken/fred-databases). The below final sample is also used in the paper and can be found under the local_factors.zip [here](https://simonfreyaldenhoven.github.io/software/). Let's read it in.

```{r}
library(l1rotation)

fred <- read.csv(file.path(me, "fred.csv"), header = FALSE)
dim(fred)
head(fred[,1:7])
```

Following Bai and Ng, this data has 8 factors. To get an idea of the the information the data conveys, we can categorize each outcome or variable into one of 14 groups below:

![Grouping of variables in panel of US macroeconomic indicators, Freyaldenhoven (2025)](macro_groups.png)

Now, let's try to estimate the 8 local factors.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 8
#| cache: true

set.seed(916)

fred_lf <- local_factors(fred, 8)

variable_groups <- c(15, 27, 61, 69, 75, 109,
                     115, 128, 137, 143, 147, 148, 154)

fred_lf$rotated_plot +
  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = variable_groups, lty = "longdash")

```

From the plot above, the first factor corresponds to group 6 and corresponds to price variables - suggesting interpretation of this factor as a price index. The second factor mainly affects interest rates, employment indicators, and industrial production while the third factor affects household balance sheets and stock markets. The picture is somewhat less clear for factors 4-8. Although the picture is somewhat less clear in terms of interpretation, we can still see that the diagnostic checking whether local factors exist decreases as $k$ increases.

```{r}
fred_lf$small_loadings_plot
```
